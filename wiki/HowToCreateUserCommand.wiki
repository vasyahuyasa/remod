= How to create user command =

== Introduction ==

At start, if you want to create scripts for remod you should know cubescript, you can find good manual here http://www.sandboxgamemaker.com/wiki/index.php?title=Cubescript.

=== Listing of our example command ===

{{{
// our callback function command
cmd_example = [
	// $arg1 - caller cn
	// $arg2 - 1st parameter 

	// get player name
	pname = (getname $arg1)

	// make formated and colored string
	fstring = (format "Player ^f0%1 ^f7type ^f0%2" $pname $arg2)

	// show string
	say $fstring
]
// register our command
registercommand "example" cmd_example 1 "s" "example [msg] ^f1Command example"
}}}

== Details ==
At start we defined cube script function which will be executed when player type `#example test`. This function can have any name but for not confuse us in future we name it `cmd_example`. When player type comand some parameters passed to our function. For us `$arg1` is player `cn` and `$arg2` is parameter which player typed after command.

After we wrote function we should register it as player command:
{{{
`registercommand "example" cmd_example 1 "s" "example [msg] ^f1Command example"`
}}}

Explanation of each parameter:

_registercommand_ – function which register our command

_"example"_ – command name which user should type 

_cmd_example_ – function which executes when user call command

_2_ – who can use that function (1 - any player, 2 -- masters, 3 - admins only)

_s_ – parameters what user should pass (s - string, for full list of parameters mnemonics see /docs/guide.html)

_"example [msg] ^f1Command example"_ – help string which user see whn type #help example.

If you want unregister that player command you can use `unregistercommand "example"` in other script.
