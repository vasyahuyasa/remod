#labels login,nameprotection
==Login System==
You need the following scripts for login & nameprotection:
 * login.cfg > scripts/other/login.cfg
 * permissions.cfg > scripts/ (override btw copy the new version)
Also you need a modifed db (check mysql/sqlite querys)

When all is setted up, you can start nameprotection.
Simply add an entry in your db with the following content:
 * name : (Name which is going protected)
 * pwd : (hashed password, depends on hash you use.)
 * perms : (permission in backend (1 = guest / 2 = master / 3 = admin)
 * state : (if is loggedin or not, DO NOT CHANGE)
 * active : (if account is active or not, should be 1 by default)

There you go, protection/permission are now active. Ingame you can login with #login password

If you want to change encryption, modifiy the following part of login.cfg (line 53)
 * {{{ if (=s (md5 $arg2) $tmp_pwd) }}} ->
to an encription level you like.
