= Maprotation =
The maprotation is controlled by maprotation rules, a rule can look like this:
{{{
maprotation "?mode " $maprotation
}}} 

== You need the following commands: ==

  * lockmaprotation (0 not locked, 1 locked but master can change, 2 locked but admin can change)
  * maprotationreset (reset all rotations at start)
  * maprotation (define a rotation rule)

== Example Rule ==
Rules are built-on like this
  * maprotationreset (first, reset all rotations)
  * maprotation command
  * mode rule (eg ?ffa)
  * assigned maprotation (variable)

Here are some example rules:

_ Rule(s) for an InstaCTF Rotation (only allow InstaCTF on $ctfmaps) _
{{{
lockmaprotation 2
maprotationreset
maprotation "?instactf " $ctfmaps
}}}

_ Rule(s) for an Coop-Edit Server (only allow coop-edit, but on every map) _
{{{
lockmaprotation 2
maprotationreset
maprotation "?coop"
}}}

_ Rule(s) for an Duelserver (all maps / modes in default rotation, but no coop) _
{{{
lockmaprotation 2
maprotationreset
maprotation "?ffa ?insta ?effic ?tac" $ffamaps
maprotation "?ctf ?hold ?protect" $ctfmaps
maprotation "?regencapture ?capture" $capturemaps
}}}
